## Overview of the analysis
We are interested in creating a bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa after seeing how successful the citibike program ran in New York City. To obtain funding from Investors, dynamic visualizations are created in Tableau using data from NYC to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

These visualizations of the New York business will convince investors that it would be a beneficial program in our city as well. 

## Results
The visualizations created in the Tableau story help to paint a picture of how this program worked in NYC.

1. Here we begin our story by showing the frequency of the pages used by each hour.

![two.png](Images/two.png)
2. It's also important for our visualizations to understand the makeup of the customers in this city.

![three.png](Images/three.png)
3. Here we can see the length of time that bikes tend to be checked out for and short trips are most often taken. 

![four.png](Images/four.png)
4. If the trip duration is broken down by gender it can still be seen that short trips are most often taken.

5. A visualization is also made to show the most popular times of the day throughout the week to use a citibike. 

![six.png](Images/six.png)
6. Upon breaking down the previous visualization by gender, the trend still follows that weekends the bikes are used all day, and bikes are used on the weekdays in the mornings/evenings.

7. Here we break down our fifth visualization once again but instead look at the most frequented hours of the week based on whether people are subscribers to the citibike program.  

## Summary
From the visualizations it can be seen that many people rely on citibike to go to nearby locations quickly throughout the city. This can be shown based on the number of subscribers and the fact that many of the trips are short in length. You can also see citibike provides a reliable way for people to get to work based off the 8am/5pm peak in use on the weekdays. To take a further in depth investigate this dataset we could perform a couple more visualizations. 
1. Given that people seem to be using this business to travel to and from work, it would be beneficial to track the most common start/stop locations based on the hour of the day.
2. Since certain locations tend to be used more than others, such as places in Manhattan, it would be an informative visualization to include the number of bikes needed at each location throughout the city to better plan for amounts of bikes needed in different locations. 
These visualizations show how successful and necessary this program has been and will assist in showing investors what an important asset this business could be.
